/*Window functions
	Window functions create a new column
	based on functions performed on a subset 
	or 'Window' of the data
		!Data reference our query output data
*/

/*
	A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow 
	related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be 
	done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a 
	window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows 
	retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access 
	more than just the current row of the query result.
