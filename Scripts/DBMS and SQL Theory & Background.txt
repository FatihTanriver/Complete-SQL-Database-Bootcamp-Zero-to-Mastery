	Imperative vs Declerative 

		Declerative:
			What will happen
			~ Make a sandwich
			I.E: SQL
			Simple, Easy to Understand
		
		
		Imperative:
			How will happen
			~ Slice bread , Slice Ham, Put Ham in Between, Make Sandwich
			I.E: Java
			More flexible, you can do lots of thing it can become complex (You must managa all extra actions)
			
		*In Python you can do both
		
		
	History of SQL
		SEQUEL ; Structured English Query Language
		than it is changed to to SQL (Due to Copyright conflict)
		
		SQL is standardized ?
		~Link: (History of Databases) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG-mqHoXOXY
		
		
	SQL Standards
		SQL 86 -- SQL 2011 -- SQL 2016

	What is a database?
		Before DB , there File Processing Systems (Saving data individual files, no relations)
					Limitation of relations leads unmanageable
				
	
	
	Database Oriented Approach
		DBMS: Database Management Software	
		! this software was the interface between your data and whatever was storing your data
		
		SQL - DBMS
		
		SQL: Unified language to talk with DBMS
		
		Which leads user focus just on the SQL 
		
		DBMS follows a specific way of structuring and saving data which called 'MODEL'
	
	Database Models
		
		Hierarchical (Old and Popular)
		Networking	(Old and Popular)
		Entity-Relationship
		Relational*
		Object Oriented
		Flat
		Semi-Structured
		..
		
		
		Hierarchical Model:
			First Used in 60s and 70s by IBM.And hasn't been seen today very much due to its inefficiencies
			Child have just one parent (one to many)
		
		
		Networking Model:
			Expand hierarchical model, allows many to many relations.
			Management perspective still complex
			
		
			
		Relational Model:
			Formalized Set of Rules
			
			?How to see the relation between two table
			One way 
				Creating third table to show the relationship
				
			!!The logic of how the relationships are linked are managed by the database.(DB management software)
			
			
	DBMS Revisited
		Link: (Codd's Rules for RDBMS)https://www.w3resource.com/sql/sql-basic/codd-12-rule-relation.php
		(The rules that have applied to DBMS in order to call it RDBMS)->According to inventor(Edgar Frank Codd) of Relational Model
		
		DBMS can do:
			- CRUD Operations
			- Manage date (where to save)
			- Secure (security policies, permissions)
			- Transaktion Management (manage differnet similtenaus transactions)
			
		Who Makes this softwares (DBMS)?
			Microsoft (MSSQL)
			IBM
			Oracle
			MySql
			PostgreSQL (Open source)
	

	Relational Model Revisited
	
		Terms: 
			-Relation Schema
			-Attribute
			-Degree
			-Cardinality
			-Tuple
			-Column
			-Relation Key
			-Domain
			-Tables
			-Relation Instance
			
		
	TABLES (Relational Model)
		each table has a name
		table has columns
		
	Columns
		each has a name
		collection of the all columns is called "Degree" _ degree of the relation
		when we talk about what a column can store, we call that "Domain/Constraint"
			i.E we have birthdate column which must be 'datetime' format, we are 'constraining it'
			
	Rows
		another word row is 'tuple'
		collection of rows is 'cardinality' of tables
		
	Primary and Foreign Keys
		Foreign Key is map the primary key of other table.
		
	OLTP vs OLAP
	
	
		OLTP: online transaction processing
			-support day to day
			
		OLAP: online analytic processing
			-support analysis
